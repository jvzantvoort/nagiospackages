      for "soft" states that take a specific action based on the host retry number.

      passed to it) used to perform the host check.

      is taken from the notes_url directive in the hostgroup definition.
  HOSTLATENCY:

      are unique across both hosts and service notifications, so you could potentially
      use this unique number as a primary key in a notification database. Notification
      ID numbers should remain unique across restarts of the Nagios process, so long
      as you have state retention enabled. The notification ID number is incremented
      by one (1) each time a new host notification is sent out, and regardless of
      how many contacts are notified.
  HOSTNOTIFICATIONNUMBER:
    definition: The current notification number for the host. The notification number
      increases by one (1) each time a new notification is sent out for the host (except
      for acknowledgements). The notification number is reset to 0 when the host recovers

      the notification number to increase, nor do notifications dealing with flap
      detection or scheduled downtime.

      macro will be non-zero if the host is currently a non-UP state. State transitions
      between non-UP states (e.g. DOWN to UNREACHABLE) do not cause this problem id
      to increase. If the host is currently in an UP state, this macro will be set
      to zero (0). Combined with event handlers, this macro could be used to automatically
      open trouble tickets when hosts first enter a problem state.

      scheduled service check lagged behind its scheduled check time. For instance,
      if a check was scheduled for 03:14:15 and it didn't get executed until 03:14:17,
      there would be a check latency of 2.0 seconds.
  SERVICENOTES:
    definition: Notes for the service. This macro may contain other macros (e.g. $HOSTNAME$
      or $SERVICESTATE$), which can be useful when you want to service-specific status
      information, etc. in the description
  SERVICENOTESURL:
    definition: Notes URL for the service. This macro may contain other macros (e.g.
      $HOSTNAME$ or $SERVICEDESC$), which can be useful when you want to pass the
      service name to a web page.
  SERVICENOTIFICATIONID:
    definition: A unique number identifying a service notification. Notification ID
      numbers are unique across both hosts and service notifications, so you could
      potentially use this unique number as a primary key in a notification database.
      Notification ID numbers should remain unique across restarts of the Nagios process,
      so long as you have state retention enabled. The notification ID number is incremented
      by one (1) each time a new service notification is sent out, and regardless
      of how many contacts are notified.
  SERVICENOTIFICATIONNUMBER:
    definition: The current notification number for the service. The notification
      number increases by one (1) each time a new notification is sent out for the
      service (except for acknowledgements). The notification number is reset to 0
      when the service recovers (after the recovery notification has gone out). Acknowledgements
      do not cause the notification number to increase, nor do notifications dealing
      with flap detection or scheduled downtime.
  SERVICEOUTPUT:
    definition: The first line of text output from the last service check (i.e. "Ping
      OK").
  SERVICEPERCENTCHANGE:
    definition: A (floating point) number indicating the percent state change the
      service has undergone. Percent state change is used by the flap detection algorithm.
  SERVICEPERFDATA:
    definition: This macro contains any performance data that may have been returned
      by the last service check.
  SERVICEPERFDATAFILE:
    definition: The location of the service performance data file (if defined).
  SERVICEPROBLEMID:
    definition: A globally unique number associated with the service's current problem
      state. Every time a service (or host) transitions from an OK or UP state to
      a problem state, a global problem ID number is incremented by one (1). This
      macro will be non-zero if the service is currently a non-OK state. State transitions
      between non-OK states (e.g. WARNING to CRITICAL) do not cause this problem id
      to increase. If the service is currently in an OK state, this macro will be
      set to zero (0). Combined with event handlers, this macro could be used to automatically
      open trouble tickets when services first enter a problem state.
  SERVICESTATE:
    definition: A string indicating the current state of the service ("OK", "WARNING",
      "UNKNOWN", or "CRITICAL").
  SERVICESTATEID:
    definition: 'A number that corresponds to the current state of the service: 0=OK,
      1=WARNING, 2=CRITICAL, 3=UNKNOWN.'
  SERVICESTATETYPE:
    definition: A string indicating the state type for the current service check ("HARD"
      or "SOFT"). Soft states occur when service checks return a non-OK state and
      are in the process of being retried. Hard states result when service checks
      have been checked a specified maximum number of times.
  SHORTDATETIME:
    definition: Current date/time stamp (i.e. 10-13-2000 00:30:28). Format of date
      is determined by date_format directive.
  STATUSDATAFILE:
    definition: The location of the status data file.
  TEMPFILE:
    definition: The location of the temp file.
  TEMPPATH:
    definition: The directory specified by the temp path variable.
  TIME:
    definition: Current time stamp (i.e. 00:30:28).
  TIMET:
    definition: Current time stamp in time_t format (seconds since the UNIX epoch).
